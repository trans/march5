# STATUS

THE STATUS FILE IS WHERE WE CAN RECORD PRESENT ON GOING DEVELOPMENT -- WHAT WE JUST DID AND WHAT IS NEXT. 

## Current

TODO: Where are we at NOW?

## Upcoming

* Context dispatch, transactions, durability policies, and richer token pools described in DESIGN-IV/V remain to be prototyped beyond placeholder node kinds.

* Namespace imports encode raw interface CIDs but do not retain alias metadata (`use` sugar) as noted in DESIGN-II (expected, but flag for future ergonomic layers).
