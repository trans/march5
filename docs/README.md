# Documentation

## Design Folder

The design directory contains documents we have been using to help guide overall design.

Do not expect them to be complete, accurate or completely aligned with implmentation.
Some things have changed due to implmentation considerations during develpoment,
but the design document haven't been update to reflect that.

## Planning Folder

The planning folder had mutiple PLAN-*md files each focused on specific plans.

When a plan is considered complete, update the progress at the top of the file,
and then it can be moved to the history folder.

Please note, that this organization came some what late to the project, so it
is not altogether complete.

## Notes

- `target/` contains compiled artifacts from the latest `cargo test` run.
